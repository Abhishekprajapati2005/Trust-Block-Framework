# Trust Block Framework

## 📌 Project Description
Trust Block Framework is a blockchain-based identity and trust scoring system.  
It enables users to create decentralized identities and assign trust scores to others based on interactions or reputation.  
The system is designed to operate transparently and without centralized control.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a secure, permissionless, and tamper-proof trust ecosystem that can be used across applications such as marketplaces, governance platforms, and decentralized communities.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Decentralized Identity Creation:** Users can register their own identity on the blockchain.
- **Trust Scoring Mechanism:** Users can increase the trust score of peers they have interacted with.
- **On-Chain Transparency:** Anyone can view identity details and trust levels.
- **Immutable Reputation History:** Trust events are recorded via blockchain logs.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add a **downvote / trust reduction** mechanism.
- Integrate **zero-knowledge proofs** for privacy-preserving identity verification.
- Introduce **governance rules** for moderating reputation abuse.
- Expand to a **modular trust framework** usable across multiple dApps.
- Add support for **ERC-20 incentives** for trustworthy behavior.
